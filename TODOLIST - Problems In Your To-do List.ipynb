    "# PROBLEMS IN YOUR TO-DO LIST\n",
    "\n",
    "CodeChef recently revamped its practice page to make it easier for users to identify the next problems they should solve by introducing some new features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recent Contest Problems - contains only problems from the last 2 contests\n",
    "- Separate Un-Attempted, Attempted, and All tabs\n",
    "- Problem Difficulty Rating - the Recommended dropdown menu has various difficulty ranges so that you can attempt the problems most suited to your experience\n",
    "- Popular Topics and Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most users, Chef didn’t know that he could add problems to a personal to-do list by clicking on the magic '+' symbol on the top-right of each problem page. But once he found out about it, he went crazy and added loads of problems to his to-do list without looking at their difficulty rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chef is a beginner and should ideally try and solve only problems with difficulty rating strictly less than 1000. Given a list of difficulty ratings for problems in the Chef’s to-do list, please help him identify how many of those problems Chef should remove from his to-do list, so that he is only left with problems of difficulty rating less than 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format\n",
    "- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases. Then the testcases follow.\n",
    "- Each testcase consists of 2 lines of input.\n",
    "- The first line of input of each test case contains a single integer, N, which is the total number of problems that the Chef - has added to his to-do list.\n",
    "- The second line of input of each test case contains N space-separated integers D1,D2,…,DN, which are the difficulty ratings for each problem in the to-do list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format\n",
    "For each test case, output in a single line the number of problems that Chef will have to remove so that all remaining problems have a difficulty rating strictly less than 1000.\n",

    "\n",
    "Test case 5: Chef does not need to remove any problem, since they are all rated <1000. So, the answer is 0."
