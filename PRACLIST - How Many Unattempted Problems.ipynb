    "# HOW MANY UNATTEMPTED PROBLEMS\n",
    "\n",
    "CodeChef recently revamped its practice page to make it easier for users to identify the next problems they should solve by introducing some new features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recent Contest Problems - contains only problems from the last 2 contests\n",
    "- Separate Un-Attempted, Attempted, and All tabs\n",
    "- Problem Difficulty Rating - the Recommended dropdown menu has various difficulty ranges so that you can attempt the problems most suited to your experience\n",
    "- Popular Topics and Tags\n",
